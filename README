Forked 15/12/2011 by MJ to turn analytics.js into a CommonJS module

---------------------------------

Welcome to the Titanium Mobile Google Analytics Example Project

I started this project by creating a Titanium Module for wrapping 
the Google Analytics SDK iOS static library. However that effort 
faild; due to using the sql dynamic library 3.0. I just could not get it working!

So, I rolled out the functionality directly in Titanium.

It works exacly the same by tracking pageviews in a database and periodically sending them to Google
Analytics, if and when a network conection is available.

Note: To make sure that the database does not get flooded with data it holds a max of 1000 events.
This also helps load when it sends the events to Google. Once the event is sent to Google it is ejected
from the database.

To use: all you need is the analytics.js file and follow the examples in the app.js.

WARNING: Although I've writen the "trackEvent" function, I haven't updated the Google Analytics
parameters to handle traking of events....ie. I still need to finish this off! :)

From Google: You must indicate to your users, either in the application itself or in your 
terms of service, that you reserve the right to anonymously track and report a user's activity 
inside of your app.

I hope some people find this useful.
